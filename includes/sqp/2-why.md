## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You got a decent audio setup that supports all HD audio formats, like Atmos, TrueHD, etc.
    - You got a TV that supports enhanced HDR formats, like DV and/or HDR10+.
    - You want the highest quality as possible to watch, but also want to save space for archiving without giving up video and audio quality.
    - You don't want to wait for the HQ Encodes to be released to be able to watch them.
